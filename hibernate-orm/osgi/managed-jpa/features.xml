    <!-- In order to utilize container-managed JPA, an Enterprise OSGi JPA container must be active in the runtime.
    For Karaf, this means Aries JPA, which is included out-of-the-box.  So, here, we activate the "jpa" and
    "transaction" features.  Originally, we intended to include those dependencies within ORM's published
    features.xml.  However, after guidance from the Karaf and Aries teams, it was pulled out.
    This allows Hibernate OSGi to be portable and not be directly tied to Aries versions, instead having
    the user choose which to use. -->

    <!-- If using Aries JPA 2.0+, explicitly starting Aries JNDI is no longer necessary.  But, in Karaf 3.0.x and
    the 2.1.0 jpa feature (above), we're still using Aries JPA 1.0.x. -->
